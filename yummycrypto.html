                <h3>Benco Terms of Service</h3>
                <p>GENERAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO ALL SERVICES
                    Employment of Agency
                    As a client, you hereby permit Benco to render, and Benco agrees to render to you, all the services customarily performed by a digital internet advertising and marketing AGENCY within such budgets as you (the client) may set from time to time for advertising, marketing, and development efforts as defined by the pitch deck and website.
                    You acknowledge that you are hiring with a Sole Proprietorship which is owned by the relevant party described in invoices.
                    Advertising & Production Rates 
                    Retainer costs are set by Benco.
                    Rates for proceeding months of work are subject to change at any time by Benco, with the exclusion of existing retainers or AGREEMENTs currently in place for that given month.
                    Every retainer fee pays for 1 month of work, after that 1-month Benco is no longer obliged to work for the CLIENT unless the next retainer fee is paid. The month of work begins when the onboarding process has been started in all departments.
                    Retainer Payment & Billing Terms
                    The CLIENT hereby agrees to pay the fees in price and schedule for Benco’s monthly retainer as listed by paying through invoice or directly to the payment address according to dates stated verbally or on invoice documents.
                    The CLIENT agrees to pay upon execution of this AGREEMENT. Benco reserves the right to stop work until payment is made.
                    Benco reserves the right to add a late fee of 5% per month on outstanding invoices at least one week past due.
                    If the CLIENT’s actions prevent the Benco Team from performing its due actions to provide its service, (such as not giving us access to social media, or lack of communication) no refund will be provided.
                    If Benco’s external circumstances prevent the Benco Team from performing its due actions to provide its service, a refund will be provided proportionally to the number of days remaining within the subscription month.
                    If Benco’s external circumstances prevent the Benco Team from performing a part of its service which is resolvable, no refund will be provided, but subscription extensions will be provided for lack of days worked due to these mitigating circumstances. 
                    Budget Payment and Billing Terms
                    When a CLIENT sends funds to Benco according to a budget plan, the CLIENT hereby grants permission for Benco to spend CLIENT’s delegated advertisement budget according to the price and schedule listed on a budget plan if they transfer funds for budget spending.
                    Benco shall not be obligated to reimburse CLIENT if their retainer subscription ends and there is the remaining budget for a budget spending. The length of time needed for budget spending will be made clear in Budget Plan Documents.
                    Benco hereby agrees to not take any percentage commission on budget transactions from the CLIENT’s budget.
                    Work Product Ownership
                    Any copyrightable works, ideas, discoveries, inventions, patents, products or other information (collectively the “Work Product” or “Deliverables”) developed in whole or in part by the Benco in connection with the AGREEMENT will be the exclusive property of the CLIENT. Upon request, Benco will execute all documents necessary to confirm or perfect the exclusive ownership of the CLIENT to the Work Product.
                    Numerical Estimates/Expectations
                    Any project estimates provided are indicative only since there is no guarantee of results provided for payment made. Performance is based on best efforts in order to renew beyond the AGREEMENT term. Actual results may be greater or less than the numbers shared based on the relevant characteristics of each individual business and other external factors.

                    Applicable Law
                    This AGREEMENT shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of The United Kingdom.
                    The CLIENT agrees that any and all legal proceedings, if necessary or enforced, will reside in The United Kingdom.
                    Enforceability
                    If any provision of this AGREEMENT is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the remainder of the AGREEMENT shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be impaired.
                    Term & Auto-Renewal
                    This AGREEMENT shall continue in force until either party terminates this AGREEMENT as per the “TERMINATION” section contained herein. Either party shall request adjustments or amendments to this AGREEMENT which will only be executed and enforced upon AGREEMENT.
                    This AGREEMENT will automatically renew in correspondence with a subscription renewal to the Benco Service.
                    Termination of Agreement
                    Termination for Convenience. The CLIENT may not terminate any AGREEMENT within the agreed-upon terms. Once the relationship shifts to a month-to-month AGREEMENT upon the conclusion of the agreed-upon initial terms, the CLIENT may cancel the month-to-month AGREEMENT for the next upcoming month by simply not renewing their subscription by not paying the retainer fee. Any budget amounts prepaid by the CLIENT or budget plans for fixed fee projects are not refundable in the event of a cancellation due to convenience. If the CLIENT wants to terminate the AGREEMENT before their subscription has ended, no refund will be provided and service will end on a verbal AGREEMENT and offboarding will occur.
                    Effects of Termination. The termination or expiration of one Statement of Work, Quote or Proposal shall not affect this AGREEMENT or any other Statement of Work, Quote or Proposal. In the event this AGREEMENT is terminated or expires and a Statement of Work, Quote or Proposal hereunder is still in effect and not terminated or expired, the provisions of this AGREEMENT shall govern such Statement of Work, Quote or Proposal until its termination or expiration.
                    Survival. The terms and conditions of this AGREEMENT that would, by their nature, survive the expiration or termination hereof, shall so survive the expiration or termination of this AGREEMENT for any reason.

                    Taxes
                    The CLIENT shall be solely responsible for filing all tax returns, tax declarations and tax schedules, and for the payment of all taxes required when due, with respect to any revenue generated by the CLIENT throughout the use of the AGENCY. 
                    Severability
                    If any provision of this Contract is held unenforceable, then such provision will be modified to reflect the parties’ intention. All remaining provisions of this Contract shall remain in full force and effect.
                    In the event of litigation relating to the subject matter of this AGREEMENT, the non-prevailing party shall reimburse the prevailing party for all reasonable attorney fees and costs resulting therefrom.
                    Non-Waiver
                    The failure by one party of this AGREEMENT to require performance of any provision(s) shall not affect that party’s right to require subsequent performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.
                    Non-Solicitation
                    The CLIENT acknowledges that he/she will acquire considerable knowledge and expertise from the AGENCY as well as from vendors, subcontractors and other employees in the course of carrying out their job duties. Furthermore, AGENCY acknowledges that he or she may be able to use such knowledge in a manner detrimental to the CLIENT. Therefore, the CLIENT agrees to the following:
                    
                    The CLIENT will not, for a period of 3 months after termination of subscription. approach any customer, affiliate, or business partner of the AGENCY for purposes of seeking employment or business arrangements in competition with the AGENCY’s line of business.
                    The CLIENT will not, for a period of 6 months following termination of his or her employment approach, entice, solicit, or contact any individual in employment at Benco Services for any reason.
                    Non-Circumvention
                    The CLIENT hereby covenants and agrees that the CLIENT will not, by amendment of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Warrant and take all action as may be reasonably required to protect the rights of the Holder.
                    Partnership 
                    The relationship between parties is not to be construed as a partnership and this Contract does not create either form of relationship.
                    Consequential Damages
                    Neither party to this Agreement will be held responsible for consequential (indirect) damages (e.g., loss of profit) because of any alleged failures by the other party.
                    Agreement Authority
                    Both parties warrant that they have read and understood the terms set forth in this AGREEMENT. Each party hereby represents and warrants that s/he is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement on behalf of the Other Party and that this Agreement is binding upon the Other Party in accordance with its terms.
                    Agreement
                    By hiring the Benco Team and agreeing to terms that include the terms of this document, the Parties acknowledge and agree to any and all provisions included in this Terms of Service AGREEMENT.

                    <p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap-letter">O</span></span> Yummy Coin ($YUMMY) is a charity-based cryptocurrency focused on providing contributions to help solve some of the world's most pressing issues. When we joined the team, the project only had a presence on Telegram, where they had about 20,000 members. The team was not experienced in handling other social media.</p>

                    <p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap-letter">O</span></span>After we joined the team, we set up a discord server and marketed it through various affiliated outlets to reach 20,000 members within the span of 6 weeks. Through hosting giveaways and shilling-based events, we have retained the server activity while bringing more hype to the coin. The Discord is currently at 22,000 members and is a shilling and community hub for Yummy Coin. Through Benco Services, Yummy diversified its community and had an increased amount of community interaction and buyers of the cryptocurrency. Benco also pushed a cross-media marketing campaign for the YUMMY token to bring it many new holders from Instagram and TikTok.</p>
