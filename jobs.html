                <h3>Benco Terms of Service</h3>
                <p>1- Scope of Services
                    We will provide you with outreach services in accordance with the particular package that you select. You will be assigned one of our project management professionals (we reserve the right to change or substitute individuals in the course of the assignment) who will implement a strategy to improve exposure for your products or services. Our work for you under this agreement will be limited to the scope of work described in the package you selected. We would be pleased to offer you assistance in other matters as you may request, but such additional services shall be at an additional cost to be mutually agreed upon. Any change in the terms and conditions of this agreement or engagement for additional services shall be set forth in writing prior to performing those services. While we will work hard for you, we cannot guarantee any particular result, nor can we promise positive coverage or investment amount, because it is not within our control. Nevertheless, we will work to implement strategies that, based on our experience, should lead to successful branding and exposure.
                    <br>
                    2- Performance Review

This Agreement does not create an association, joint venture, or partnership between the parties, nor impose any partnership liability upon either party. Benco Services acknowledges that it is not entitled to any benefits of employment from Client and represents that it will pay all fees and taxes required by law to perform Benco Services’s obligations under this Agreement.

If we must retain counsel to enforce this agreement, you shall be responsible for all such costs and expenses including reasonable attorney’s fees.
